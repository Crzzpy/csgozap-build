# csgozap-build
This was my first "big" solo side project. A steam csgo skin based gambling website, focused on p2p coinflips. Build on node.js.

Once reached about 9k followers on twitter @csgozap with a peak concurrent users amount of 112 just 2 weeks after launch.

Started development at the start of my software developer career, launched at the start of 2018.

This repository is just for nostalgia factor for me.

- The code isnt very clean
- The project structure is messy
- It will not work since its based on alot of outdated modules and server data infos which do not exist anymore since years

Cheers ðŸ¤™
